I just want to take the time to thank you Matthew Prince for the opportunity to apply and hopefully participate in the internship program. So many individuals, like myself, had summer plans and were ready to intern at various companies for the summer, but the current situation has really changed the scene for many. I'm so grateful for the initiavte taken to double the size of the internships provided this summer meaning that indivdiuals like myself can still grow and progress in knowledge and their careers. Thank you and look forward to being part of such great company like yours Sir! 

Sincerely,

Chelesa K
